### 👩🏻‍💻 What I learnt

- make random number between min and max num.

```javascript
Math.round(Math.random() * (max - min) + min);
```

- **Event.isTrusted**

  - read-only property of the Event interface is a Boolean that is true when the event was generated by a user action, and false when the event was created or modified by a script or dispatched via EventTarget.dispatchEvent().

- **WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope.setTimeout()**
  - The setTimeout() method of the WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope mixin (and successor to Window.setTimeout()) sets a timer which executes a function or specified piece of code once the timer expires.
