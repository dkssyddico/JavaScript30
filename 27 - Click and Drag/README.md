# Day 27 Challenge: 27 - Click and Drag

<br>

## 2021. Mar. 23th

<br>

### 💙 goals of this course

- click and drag as we want to go through it

<br>

### 👩🏻‍💻 What I learnt

- use variables wisely
- should set the starting point and measure how much we drag
- `mousedown`: is fired at an Element when a pointing device button is pressed while the pointer is inside the element.
